# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

## Project Overview

  The goal of Rock, Paper, Scissors was to demonstrate knowledge and skills built during Mod 1 at Turing. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I built a browser-based Rock, Paper, Scissors style game with Classic and Challenge gameplay modes. Some of the technical focuses for this project included:
  - Writing clean, DRY JavaScript that demonstrates developer empathy
  - Utilizing localStorage for persistent data across refreshes
  - Utilizing event delegation for similar event listeners
  - Maintaining a clear separation between the DOM and Data Model

### Challenges
  - Maintaining a clear separation between the Data Model and DOM manipulation was tricky for this project! There have been several instances where I needed to refactor to improve this separation, and I'm sure that I can still continue to improve in this area.
  - I ran into an event delegation issue where clicking on the text inside of a button would not fire the correct event listener. This took some careful investigation into how my event listeners were working. 
### Wins
  - I felt much more comfortable using localStorage in this project.
  - While keeping the Data Model and DOM manipulation separate was challenging, I feel like my understanding has improved a lot over the course of the project.
  - Utilizing event delegation in this project greatly helped to improve my skills using event targets.
